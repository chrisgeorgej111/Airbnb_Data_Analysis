# Airbnb_Data_Analysis
Data Visualisation Airbnb listing

Airbnb Data:
Airbnb is something that occupies persons who go for a work trip, family holidady trip,weekend gataway.
So the airbnb data usually consists of the host_id,name,available bedrooms,ammenities,address,neighbourhoood,
rating,price,cancellation fee,some terms and conditions.

In my project, i have scrapped the data from sample data of Mongodb atlas.
Afer scrapping i have done some basic EDA process like feature engineering,data type_casting,filling up the missing values and so on.

After EDA i have created a Analysis of the data using plotly.express.
i have done the price analysis,rating analysis,availability_analysis, Property and room_analysis.
i have displayed all through streamlit dashboard and Tableau Dashboard.
